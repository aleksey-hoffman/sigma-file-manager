- Supporters are added to the list from top to bottom. The earlier you start supporting the project, the higher your name will be on the list.
- "3+ months" supporters will have the ‚≠ê badge displayed next to their name.
- The funding will be used for:
  - Fund the development of this project;
  - Fund the development of my other big research project: advanced tools / algorithms that will help scientists speed up development of new medications and treatments for diseases, reducing the time need to find a new medication from 10 years (current average) to just a few months, and hopefully help humanity get rid of diseases;
  - Support other open-source and open-content creators (developers, educators, digital artists, etc);
