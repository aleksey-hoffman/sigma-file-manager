The funding will be used for funding the development of this and my other big projects. I'm also working in collaboration with a few universities on a project that will help scientists speed up development of new medications and treatments for diseases, reducing the time need to find a new medication from 10 years (current average) to just a few months, and hopefully help humanity get rid of diseases (the project will be open-sourced later);
